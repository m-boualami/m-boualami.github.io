<p>In this course, I guide students through an engaging exploration of how digital platforms are transforming Berlin’s live music landscape. Using Resident Advisor, a key event-promotion app, as our case study, we delve into the geographies of the city’s electronic music industry and analyse the influence of these platforms on the local music economy.</p>

<p>In the workshop’s first steps, students engage with one of the key challenges in research: responsible handling of personal data.</p>

<p>For academics and research professionals, one key challenge with personal data concerns dissemination. Reproducibility is central to scientific rigor: other researchers must be able to reproduce experiments on the same datasets to validate results and claims. Beyond the question of validation, there is a growing issue of access to empirical data. The increasing privatisation of online spaces by major corporations such as Meta or X, coupled with restricted APIs, has made many datasets inaccessible to researchers studying online dynamics. Only a limited group, often those working within public-private partnerships like my team, can obtain these data. Ensuring equitable access and responsible dissemination of such proprietary datasets is therefore crucial. It allows researchers outside these partnerships to engage in independent research, contributing to a fairer and more open scientific landscape while mitigating corporate influence.</p>

<p>Responsible dissemination in the European Union is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which provides a comprehensive legal framework for the collection, processing, storage, and sharing of personal data. Personal data is defined as any information that can be linked to an identifiable individual, such as names, addresses, or phone numbers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, research institutes were granted specific allowances to access personal health records that had previously been strictly protected, enabling researchers to use and share such data under controlled conditions while remaining compliant with GDPR standards. A central requirement for the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of personal data is proper anonymisation, ensuring that individuals cannot be identified from the data while preserving its utility for research purposes. There are threee main approaches commonly applied for anonymisation : Remove. Replace. Aggregate.</p>

<p>Complete anonymisation removes all direct and indirect identifiers, making it impossible to trace data back to any individual. This provides the strongest privacy protection but can reduce the usefulness of the data for certain types of analysis. Pseudonymisation, the most common approach, replaces identifying information with artificial identifiers or codes. This allows data to remain linkable for longitudinal studies or cross-referencing while limiting direct identification. Aggregation is a complete transformation of the dataset, which groups individual records into categories, summarising variables using averages or medians. This reduces re-identification risk but is generally discouraged in research, as it causes significant information loss.</p>

<p>In the workshop, students choose an anonymisation approach, implement it on the dataset, and discuss how each choice affects data utility, research reproducibility, and ethical compliance to GDPR. Through this exercise, students gain hands-on experience that encourages them to be mindful of data protection in their future research, while developing a critical and reflexive understanding of GDPR guidelines and ethical practices.</p>
