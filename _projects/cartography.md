description: Reflections on fieldwork in Lima, Peru
---

In 2019, for my master’s thesis, I conducted fieldwork in Lima, Peru, focusing on women’s experiences in the city. Working with the Municipalidad de Barranco, a central district, I led a participatory mapping project with women from different neighbourhoods to explore how they perceive and navigate urban space, and how these experiences relate to feelings of safety and insecurity.
