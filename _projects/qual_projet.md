# A contextual understanding of automatic music genre classification

Since the rise of web-data collection and analysis in the Humanities, debates about their epistemologies have shifted from a technodeterminist, neopositivist approach toward a more critical perspective that recognises the multiple ways algorithms shape the production of online data. Online practices are increasingly understood not as isolated individual actions, but as the outcome of complex interactions between users, algorithms, engineers, and other stakeholders of digital platforms. While many concepts and theoretical frameworks exist to describe these dynamics such as the very relevant notion of "algorithmic assemblages", few studies have closely examined the concrete processes that underpin these assemblages.

This project aimed to address that gap. Using a method I call “triangulation,” I combined interviews with Deezer R&D staff, methodological papers from the field of Music Information Retrieval, and grey literature such as online documentation, in order to precisely map the algorithmic assemblage that produced one specific dataset: music genre tags on a streaming platform. The project revealed how a single algorithm, designed to organise thousands of genre tags into a smaller, more reliable taxonomy, actually relies on numerous other algorithmic processes external to the studied streaming platform, as well as previous open-access datasets created with contributions from countless internet users over the past decades which raises questions about user consent and the ethics of unpaid digital labour.

Finally, this work also nuances critiques of rationalisation through quantification and automated processing, by showing how much effort is invested in this specific algorithm. Its goal is not merely optimisation, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the production of knowledge.
