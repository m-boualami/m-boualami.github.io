# Contextualising algorithmic assemblage: the case of automatic music genre classification on Deezer

Over the past two decades, the Humanities have increasingly turned to large-scale online data. From the outset, critics highlighted the techno-determinist and neo-positivist tendencies of researchers working with such material, who treated data as a pure representation of individual actions, assuming it directly mirrored real intentions and practices. Building on these important critiques, a more reflexive perspective has since emerged. Online practices are now less often seen as isolated individual actions, and more as the outcome of complex interactions between users, algorithms, engineers, and the broader stakeholders shaping digital platforms. While many concepts and theoretical frameworks exist to describe these dynamics such as the very relevant notion of "algorithmic assemblages", few studies have closely examined the concrete processes that underpin these assemblages.

This project aimed to address that gap. Using a method we coined “triangulation”, we combine interviews with Deezer R&D staff, methodological papers from the field of Music Information Retrieval, and grey literature such as documentation, in order to precisely map the algorithmic assemblage that produced one specific meta-data present in our dataset: music genre tags on a streaming platform. The project revealed how a single *translation* algorithm, designed to organise thousands of heterogeneous genre tags from labels and distributors worldwide into a smaller, more reliable taxonomy, actually depends on numerous other algorithmic processes outside the studied streaming platform. More strikingly, this translation algorithm is trained on open-access datasets compiled with contributions from countless internet users over the past decades, which raises questions about user consent and the ethics of unpaid digital labour. Beyond the "assemblage", it might be better seen as an "algorithmic octopus", its tentacles reaching across the web in search of other databases to feed on.

Finally, the project highlights how platform engineers critically assess the platform, its requirements, and its operations. It invites researchers working on platform topics to engage with these professionals, who often come from academia themselves and are frequently more independent and less swayed by industry pressures than one might expect.
