# The geography of music platform business models : From local data extraction to global circulation

At the heart of the digital economy lies a fundamental scalar tension. Platforms capture data at the most local and individual level: a click, a listening session, a location trace. Yet this information only acquires value once it is aggregated and circulated on a global scale, where patterns can be identified, markets segmented, and predictions monetised. This movement from local extraction to global valorisation is what underpins the remarkable scalability of platform business models. Music streaming offers a clear illustration. While data is extracted from individual users, platforms must simultaneously “localise” their offer to make it culturally relevant. They deploy localisation algorithm, while editorial teams curate region-specific playlists and highlight local artists. This dual operation demonstrates that, even within a supposedly borderless economy, the local remains indispensable to the creation of global value.

This scalar dynamic also shapes the ambivalent relationship between digital platforms and states. On the one hand, technology firms prosper through the dissolution of borders, bypassing national regulations in matters such as data protection or taxation. Their infrastructures are designed to move data seamlessly across jurisdictions, exploiting regulatory gaps and the slow pace of multilateral agreements. In this sense, they actively escape the reach of the state. On the other hand, platforms remain deeply dependent on national jurisdictions when it comes to intellectual property. Music, films, or any digital goods tied to copyright cannot generate revenue without the legal enforcement of ownership rights. For this reason, platforms participate in global industry consortia that establish standardised metadata protocols, ensuring that copyright is traceable and enforceable across borders. This paradox highlights their double game: evading state control in terms of regulation, whilst simultaneously relying on state authority to secure their economic model.
