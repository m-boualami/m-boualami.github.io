# To be successfull in a digitised world

With the rise of digital platforms, the barriers to publishing music have never been lower, and in principle, the path to success has been democratised: any artist can share their work online, and any listener, anywhere, can discover it. Yet the music industry has long been structured by gatekeeping, where success depended on being in the right place and knowing the right people. Has digitisation truly dissolved these barriers, or do geography and social ties still matter? 

This project takes the “death of distance” hypothesis and applies it to music, asking whether digitisation has truly dissolved spatial hierarchies. In doing so, it reveals the ways in which geography still structures musical innovation and success, even in an era of seemingly borderless innovation networks. We uncover an intriguing contradiction: a simultaneous process of centralisation and decentralisation in music scenes. Paris, the historic hub of the French music industry, remains more influential than ever, while highly successful yet isolated artists also emerge in rural regions that historically struggled to produce notable acts. The main losers of this dual movement are intermediate scenes, large cities outside Paris that historically competed with the capital and now struggle to achieve the same level of success. This project is one of the first to empirically investigate, at a very fine-grained level, the “death of distance” hypothesis in France, bringing together two seemingly opposing perspectives that, as the results show, are not actually contradictory.

# Subgenres from the ground-up thematic analysis

The curation of artists, whether on the radio, television, in magazines, or record stores, has historically followed the logic of genre, grouping musicians into categories defined by intermediaries. This top-down dominance of genre categories meant that audiences consumed music in a highly segregated way, a pattern sociologists have consistently observed over the past forty years. Today, however, digital platforms promise a world of personalised media consumption, supposedly free from the gatekeeping of traditional intermediaries and their genre-based logics of curation. Has this shift diminished the importance of genre in shaping musical tastes and preferences?

This project investigates this question by identifying the thematic boundaries that structure music consumption among rap listeners on Deezer. We find that it is not traditional genre labels, but rather broader “themes,” that guide how audiences engage with music. By constructing seven clusters of artists and interpreting their meaning through topic modelling of song lyrics, we revealed distinct patterns of audience preference. When comparing across age and gender, we uncovered a striking fact: while women of all ages share similar preferences, and older men likewise cluster together, younger men (aged 13 to 24) align more closely with women’s preferences than with those of older men. This generational divide in highly individualised, personalised music consumption reflects broader debates about “generational wars”, where age has become one of the sharpest lines of division in contemporary democracies.
