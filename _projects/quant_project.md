# To be successfull in a digitised world

This project dives into the spatial hierarchies of rap music in France from a relational perspective, using an original dataset of consumption patterns of emerging artists on the music streaming platform Deezer. It examines the hypotheses of the “death of distance” and the “death of centrality,” showing the specific ways in which space continues to structure musical innovation and success, despite the dematerialisation and devaluation of traditional modes of music distribution.

# Subgenres from the ground-up thematic analysis

This project examines the musical boundaries that emerge from the distinct consumption patterns of rap audiences. Using the actual listening histories of around 1000 French users of the music streaming platform Deezer, we apply dimensionality reduction and clustering methods to explore the musical boundaries that emerge from distinctive audience consumption patterns, with a particular focus on rap music. We show that these boundaries exhibit salient thematic distinctions, and each region of the map holds its own combination of themes. Focusing on six demographic groups based on age and gender, we find that each exhibits a unique pattern of music preference across the highlighted boundaries. Our findings deepen and renew our understanding of the dynamics in which music boundaries are formed, and highlight the importance of studying and comprehending these dynamics, showcasing one way to shed light on that matter.
