# To be successfull in a digitised world

With the rise of digital platforms, the barriers to publishing music have never been lower, and in principle, the path to success has been democratised: any artist can share their work online, and any listener, anywhere, can discover it. Yet the music industry has long been structured by gatekeeping, where success depended on being in the right place and knowing the right people. Has digitisation truly dissolved these barriers, or do geography and social ties still matter? This project takes the “death of distance” hypothesis and applies it to music, asking whether digitisation has truly dissolved spatial hierarchies. In doing so, it reveals the ways in which geography still structures musical innovation and success, even in an era of seemingly borderless innovation networks. We uncover an intriguing contradiction: a simultaneous process of centralisation and decentralisation in music scenes. Paris, the historic hub of the French music industry, remains more influential than ever, while highly successful yet isolated artists also emerge in rural regions that historically struggled to produce notable acts. The main losers of this dual movement are intermediate scenes—large cities outside Paris that historically competed with the capital and now struggle to achieve the same level of success. This project is one of the first to empirically investigate, at a very fine-grained level, the “death of distance” hypothesis in France, bringing together two seemingly opposing perspectives that, as the results show, are not actually contradictory.

# Subgenres from the ground-up thematic analysis

This project examines the musical boundaries that emerge from the distinct consumption patterns of rap audiences. Using the actual listening histories of around 1000 French users of the music streaming platform Deezer, we apply dimensionality reduction and clustering methods to explore the musical boundaries that emerge from distinctive audience consumption patterns, with a particular focus on rap music. We show that these boundaries exhibit salient thematic distinctions, and each region of the map holds its own combination of themes. Focusing on six demographic groups based on age and gender, we find that each exhibits a unique pattern of music preference across the highlighted boundaries. Our findings deepen and renew our understanding of the dynamics in which music boundaries are formed, and highlight the importance of studying and comprehending these dynamics, showcasing one way to shed light on that matter.
