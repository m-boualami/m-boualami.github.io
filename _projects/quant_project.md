# To be successfull in a digitised world

With the rise of digital platforms, the barriers to publishing music have never been lower, and in principle, the path to success has been democratised: any artist can share their work online, and any listener, anywhere, can discover it. Yet the music industry has long been structured by gatekeeping, where success depended on being in the right place and knowing the right people. Has digitisation truly dissolved these barriers, or do geography and social ties still matter? 

This project takes the “death of distance” hypothesis and applies it to music, asking whether digitisation has truly dissolved spatial hierarchies. We uncover an intriguing contradiction : a simultaneous process of **centralisation and decentralisation** in music scenes. The Paris region, the French music industry's historic hub, remains more influential than ever. At the same time, rural regions that historically struggled to produce notable acts are now finally generating successful artists, often at levels proportional to their population. This emergence of talent from previously underrepresented areas highlights a **new geographical diversification of success** in the French music scene. The main losers of this dual movement are intermediate scenes, large cities outside Paris that historically competed with the capital and now struggle to achieve the same level of success.

Moreover, we examined how artists’ embeddedness in their regional scene (i.e, the degree to which their social network is locally concentrated) relates to the longevity of their success. We found that artists in the Paris region tend to exhibit a high degree of localness, whereas most other regions show little to none. The main exception is the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, historically France’s second rap hub : artists with highly local networks were more likely to lose their audience, while those whose networks were oriented toward Paris tended to continue growing. This suggests that, even with the geographical decentralization of success, **connections to Paris remain crucial**.

This project is one of the first to empirically investigate, at a very fine-grained level, the “death of distance” hypothesis in France, bringing together two seemingly opposing perspectives that, as the results show, are not actually contradictory.

# Subgenres from the ground-up thematic analysis

The curation of artists, whether on the radio, television, in magazines, or record stores, has historically followed the logic of genre, grouping musicians into categories defined by intermediaries. This top-down dominance of genre categories meant that audiences consumed music in a highly segregated way, a pattern sociologists have consistently observed over the past forty years. Today, however, digital platforms promise a world of personalised media consumption, supposedly free from the gatekeeping of traditional intermediaries and their genre-based logics of curation. Has this shift diminished the importance of genre in shaping musical tastes and preferences ?

This project explores how rap audiences structure their music consumption on Deezer. Rather than following traditional genre labels, listeners appear to organise their engagement around broader themes. We identified seven thematic clusters of artists using dimension reduction and topic modelling of song lyrics to understand each cluster. Then, by applying a predictive model on audience preferences across these clusters, we examined how age and gender relate to listening habits. The results revealed a striking pattern : women of all ages share similar preferences, and older men tend to cluster together. Yet younger men (aged 12–24) align more closely with women’s preferences than with those of older men. This generational divide in highly personalised music consumption echoes broader societal debates about “generational wars”, where age has become one of the sharpest lines of division in contemporary democracies.
