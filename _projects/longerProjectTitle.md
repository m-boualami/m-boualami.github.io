# A contextual understanding of automatic music genre classification

Since the popularisation of web-data collection and analysis in the Humanities, debates about their epistemologies have moved from a technodeterminist, neopositivist approach to going toward a more critical take that acknowledge the multipule ways in which algorithms shape the production of online data. Online practices are more and more understood as restricted rather than xx. Now, online practices are better understood as the result of complex systems of interactions between users but also between algorithms, engineers, and stakeholders of the online spaces. If there is a plethora of concepts, notions and theorical lingos to point at such dynamics, few researches (cite jérémie) have delve deeply into the examination of the actual processes that underpin those assemblages.

This project aimed at bridging that gap. By using a method i coined 'triangulation' (on the basis of xxx), i used interveiw with Deezer R&D, methodologic papers in the field of Music Information Retrieval, as well as grey literature as online documentation to triangulate precisemly the algorithmic assemblage that produced one specific data - music genre tags on streaming platform.

From that project, I unveiled the ways in which one algorithm, the one used by the platform to sort thousands of genre tags into a smaller, more trustable taxonomy, this one relies in reality on many, many other algorithmic assemblages as well as previous open-access datasets built on the contribution of many, many internet dwellers in the last decades. 

Platforms such as Deezer present themselves as an opening on the world - one contact point in the internet web that held a database of most of the world. In tension with that pretension, they put much effort into localising, specifically through translation but not just of corporas of world - in our case study, localisation of music taxonomies. This project unveiled the ways in which platforms complile *a* world targeted to *localised* users.

Beyond this analysis, i temper the xxx critics of rationalisation through quantification and automated treatment by showing how much effort is invested in that specific algorithm when its end-goal is not necessarely the one of optimisation, but more interestingly, the one of knowledge production.
