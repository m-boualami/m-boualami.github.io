# <span style="font-size: 3.5rem; line-height: 1.2;">Data in practice. Collection, Management and Analysis</span>

Welcome.

I am a research engineer with hands-on experience managing large datasets throughout their entire life cycle, including data collection, cleaning, documentation, processing, analysis, and long-term maintenance. Much of my work centres on online data, where questions of quality, context and protection are especially important.

Several of my project involved diving into large-scale dataset from online platform to explore online dynamics, specifically in the case of music practices

Beyond the technical side, I also pay attention to how online data is produced in the first place. This involves looking at algorithms and the engineers who build them, the way platforms are designed, and the varied contexts and practices that shape how people behave online. Drawing on this understanding, my work explores how online data can be used to empirically investigate pressing questions about contemporary life.
