I am a research engineer and data professional with experience across the full life cycle of large datasets, from collection and cleaning to processing, analysis and long-term maintenance. Much of my work centres on online data, where questions of quality, context and protection are especially important.

Beyond the technical side, I also pay attention to how online data is produced in the first place. This involves looking at algorithms and the engineers who build them, the way platforms are designed, and the varied contexts and practices that shape how people behave online.

Drawing on this understanding, my work explores how online data can be used to empirically investigate pressing questions about contemporary life. A geographer at heart, I examine how the growing digitisation of life is reshaping urban hierarchies and patterns of regional polarisation, using the music industry as a case study.
