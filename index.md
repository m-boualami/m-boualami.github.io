# <span style="font-size: 3.5rem; line-height: 1.2;">(Geo)data in practice. Collection, Management and Analysis</span>

Welcome.

I explore the world through data and maps, combining spatial analysis and data modeling with hands-on experience managing large, complex datasets across their full life cycle : from collection and cleaning to documentation, processing, analysis, and long-term maintenance. Much of my work focuses on **geolocated digital traces generated by online platforms**, where challenges of data quality, contextualisation, and compliance with data protection standards are particularly critical.

Using **geospatial and computational methods**, I [empirically investigate](https://m-boualami.github.io/projects/quant-project/){:target="_blank"} pressing questions about contemporary life, linking digital traces to social, cultural, and spatial dynamics. Beyond the operational side, I explore [how online data is produced](https://m-boualami.github.io/projects/qual-projet/){:target="_blank"} in the first place. This involves examining algorithms, platform design, and the varied social and geographical contexts that shape user behaviour.
