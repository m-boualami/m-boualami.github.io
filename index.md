I am a researcher and data professional specialising in the end-to-end management of complex datasets, from large-scale collection and cleaning to processing, analysis, and long-term maintenance. Much of my work focuses on data generated by digital platforms and social networks, with attention to issues of quality, context, and protection.

My approach is structured and pragmatic, with the aim of making data reliable, intelligible, and usable across diverse contexts.
