# <span style="font-size: 3.5rem; line-height: 1.2;">Data in practice. Collection, Management and Analysis</span>

Welcome.

I am a research engineer with hands-on experience managing large datasets throughout their entire life cycle, from collection and cleaning to documentation, processing, analysis, and long-term maintenance. Much of my work focuses on digital user traces generated by online platforms, where issues of data quality, contextualisation, and compliance with data protection standards are especially critical.

Beyond the operational side, I also pay attention to [how online data is produced](https://m-boualami.github.io/projects/qual-projet/){:target="_blank"} in the first place. This involves looking at algorithms and the engineers who build them, the way platforms are designed, and the varied contexts and practices that shape how people behave online. Drawing on this understanding, my work explores how online data can be used to [empirically investigate](https://m-boualami.github.io/projects/quant-project/){:target="_blank"} pressing questions about contemporary life.
